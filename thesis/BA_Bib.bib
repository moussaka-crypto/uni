	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) connects users with interconnection of things to facilitate the life. IoT is now shifted towards `Thing to Thing'. Smart home concept brings comfort and convenience in our lives with the aid of IoT. Major issues in current smart home scenario are automation and security. Problem in security arises due to network of devices in the home with internet. Focus is sifted towards providing confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of data sensed and exchanged by smart home objects. Computation overhead is also a concern for smart home solutions. Comfort and user requirements as per scenario or situation are basic need for automation. Automation with learning human behavior is also a major concern with smart home concept. Paper represents IoT based smart home automation approach which is secure and also reduces computation overhead.},

	abstract = {As cross-border access becomes more frequent, traditional perimeter-based network security models can no longer cope with evolving security requirements. Zero trust is a novel paradigm for cybersecurity based on the core concept of “never trust, always verify”. It attempts to protect against security risks related to internal threats by eliminating the demarcations between the internal and external network of traditional network perimeters. Nevertheless, research on the theory and application of zero trust is still in its infancy, and more extensive research is necessary to facilitate a deeper understanding of the paradigm in academia and the industry. In this paper, trust in cybersecurity is discussed, following which the origin, concepts, and principles related to zero trust are elaborated on. The characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing research are analysed in the context of zero trust achievements and their technical applications in Cloud and IoT environments. Finally, to support the development and application of zero trust in the future, the concept and its current challenges are analysed.},

	abstract = {Smart home is a habitation that has been outfitted with technological solutions that are intended to provide people with services that are suited to their needs. The purpose of this article is to perform a systematic assessment of the latest smart home literature and to conduct a survey of research and development conducted in this field. In addition to presenting a complete picture of the current smart home system’s (SHS) development and characteristics, this paper provides a deep insight into latest hardware and trends. The research then moves on to a detailed discussion of some of the important services provided by the SHS and its advantages. The paper also statistically discusses the current and future research trends in the SHS, followed by a detailed portrayal of the difficulties and roadblocks in implementing them. The comprehensive overview of the SHS presented in this paper will help designers, researchers, funding agencies, and policymakers have a bird’s-eye view of the overall concept, attributes, technological aspects, and features of modern SHSs.},

From the conceptualizations, we provide a definition of IoT and present its implications and impact on future research in Marketing that interfaces with information systems, design and innovation, data science and cybersecurity, as well as organizational studies and economics. By integrating the implications of IoT with extant literature, we then propose a set of priorities for future research in this area.},

	abstract = {Home automation has achieved a lot of popularity in recent years, as day-to-day life is getting simpler due to the rapid growth of technology. Almost everything has become digitalized and automatic. In this paper, a system for interconnecting sensors, actuators, and other data sources with the purpose of multiple home automations is proposed. The system is called qToggle and works by leveraging the power of a flexible and powerful Application Programming Interface (API), which represents the foundation of a simple and common communication scheme. The devices used by qToggle are usually sensors or actuators with an upstream network connection implementing the qToggle API. Most devices used by qToggle are based on ESP8266/ESP8285 chips and/or on Raspberry Pi boards. A smartphone application has been developed that allows users to control a series of home appliances and sensors. The qToggle system is user friendly, flexible, and can be further developed by using different devices and add-ons.},
